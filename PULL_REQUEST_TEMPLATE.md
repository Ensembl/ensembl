### Requirements

- Filling out the template is required. Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion;
- The pull request (PR) brings in a useful change;
- Document the change in code at an appropriate level: not too terse, but not too verbose
- Do not introduce just single line comments which serve no help to the code
- Do not remove essential code
- PR's history is not too complex: we want to see as close to a linear set of commits resulting in your final change; we will ask for multiple internal merges to be squished into a sensible set of commits
- Do not write poor commit messages
- Do not repeat the same message in multiple commits
- Do not introduce excessive whitespace changes
- Do not reformat someone else's code; it's just bad manners
- Do not modify code without testing for regression
- Do please provide simple unit tests to test the changes
- If you change the schema you must patch the test DBs
