Encode regions	Regions that were examined in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.genome.gov/10005107">Encode</a> pilot project.
Genomic contigs	The largest contigs constructed by the Genome Reference Consortium, <a rel="external" href="http://genomereference.org">GRC</a>, for this genomic assembly.
Tilepath	BAC clones upon which the current genomic assembly was based.  Colours indicate a finished sequence (gold clones), phase 1 sequencing (dark pink), phase 0 (light pink) or other (grey).  Clones that have been fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) mapped are marked with a black triangle in the top left corner.  If a clone is shown in outline, the mapping to the genome is problematic and the true length may not be displayed. 
1Mb clone set	Clones were selected at approximately 1MB intervals in the genome to help identify breakpoints of chromosomal rearrangements.  Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) mapped clones are marked by a black triangle in the upper left corner.  Gold clones are also in the tilepath.
32k clone set	Clones were re-arrayed by and available at <a rel="external" href="http://bacpac.chori.org/pHumanMinSet.htm">CHORI</a>. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) mapped clones are marked by a black triangle in the upper left corner.  Gold clones are also in the tilepath.
30k clone set	Clone positions were determined by a Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute  <a rel="external" href="https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/perl/application?action=arraytypes;array_id=20">internal project</a>.
