# A seq_region that is not represented in a more global coordinate system
# should get the toplevel attribute and value 1
# If you have more than one assembly in you database, this feature will
# not work as expected. You should then explicitly request features in a specific
# cordinate system
6	toplevel	Top Level	Top Level Non-Redundant Sequence Region

# The number of genes on each seq_region is counted and stored under this
# seq_region_attribute to be displayed on mapview. Mainly web code uses this.

# another seq_region attribute. When a seq_region should be used with a
# different codon table this attrbutes value should contain its number.
# This is a bioperl codon table, find out from there which number to use
# for your seq_region
# Useful for Mitochondrium and Bacteria with non standard codon tables
11	codon_table	Codon Table	Alternate codon table

# This is an attribute for a translation. Values describe start and end
# position of a seelnocystein in a Translation (Amino Acid coordinates)
