Ensembl stable ID mapping
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please post questions to the Ensembl developers mailing list
<http://lists.ensembl.org/mailman/listinfo/dev>


The scripts in this directory are used in Ensembl production to map
stable IDs between one release and another.

Please refer to the documents in ensembl-doc/id_mapping/ for both user
and developer level documentation.

The following is a quick start with a bare bones description of the
steps we go through when we run the stable ID mapping for an Ensembl
release:


QUICK START

1.  Empty stable IDs from target database, or back them up using the
    utils/myManager.ksh script.

2.  As a sanity check, compare the gene biotypes in source and target
    databases.

3.  Create a configuration file (use the file 'default.conf' as the template).

4.  Run the mapping using the myRun.ksh script.

5.  Study the result.
