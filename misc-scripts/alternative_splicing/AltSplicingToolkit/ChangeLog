	altSpliceFinder modification.
	Corrected options to compute statistics (--statistiscs|-s)

	altSpliceFinder modification.
	* relax mode: option ``-relax|-r'' to compute cassette exons 
	and mutually exclusive events with relaxed constraints on 
	flanking exons.
	In this mode, flanking exons are required to overlap but the 
	constraints on the same 3p or 5p end are removed.
	* bug on A5SS computation fixed.
	* remove spurious STDERR logs on intron retention event 
	computations.

        Release Version 0.4.
        * NEWS: Mention the release.

2009-05-12  Gautier Koscielny  <koscieln@ebi.ac.uk>

	Add constitutives option:
	* modify Main.cpp: add an option to compute constitutive exons.
	* modify gff/SplicingEventGffGenerator.cpp to compute constitutive
	  exons only if the constitutives flag is on
	Fix bug on constitutive exon computations. An exonic region is said
	to be constitutive if and only if the number of transcripts covering 
	this region is equal to the number of known transcripts for this gene.
	Any other exon is subject to a splicing event. 
	* modify as/RegionChunk.cpp to correctly merge a set of transcript exon
	locations.
