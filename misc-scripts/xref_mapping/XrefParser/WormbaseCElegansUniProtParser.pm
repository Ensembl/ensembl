# UniProt xrefs are sometimes - really - dependent xrefs of
# INSDC entries which we get from somewhere else
# Attempt to find the parent (has to already be present in the xref table)
# INSDC and UniProt entries have the same protein sequence, and
# UniProt lists INSDC as a parent. We get INSDC entries from somewhere else,
# so make UniProt entries dependent on INSDC entries.
# Note:
# INSDC entries have coordinates, and UniProt entries don't.
# So for perfect homologs, there can be many INSDC entries per UniProt.
