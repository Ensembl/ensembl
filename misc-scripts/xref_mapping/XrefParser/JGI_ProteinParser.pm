=head1 NAME

XrefParser::JGI_ProteinParser

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parser for JGI-1.0 protein files with gene description, FASTA format.

WARNING: this is an extremely simplistic implementation of a FASTA
parser, for instance it does not treat strings beginning with ; as
comments. As of September 2019 it (still) works for JGI data, though.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $parser = XrefParser::JGI_ProteinParser->new($db->dbh);
  $parser->run({
    source_id  => 70,
    species_id => 7719,
    files      => [ "ciona.prot.fasta.gz" ],
  });

  Arg []     : HashRef standard list of arguments from ParseSource
  Example    : $jgi_parser->run({ ... });
  Description: Parse FASTA input file containing JGI-1.0 protein data,
               extract seq xrefs and add them to the xref DB
  Return type: Int; 0 upon success
  Exceptions : throws on all processing errors
  Caller     : ParseSource in the xref pipeline
