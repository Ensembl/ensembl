  Description: Extract Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man entries
               from a text file downloaded from the OMIM Web site,
               then insert corresponding xrefs into the xref
               database. Note that all the xrefs produced by this
               parser are unmapped and tagged as such; links of
               appropriate type will be inserted by Mim2GeneParser.

               OMIM entries can either represent a unique locus,
               describe a disorder, or both. In Ensembl these are
               assigned, respectively, to: the source MIM_GENE,
               the source MIM_MORBID, or independently into both.

               OMIM records are multiline. Each record begins with a
               specific tag line and consists of a number of
               fields. Each field starts with its own start-tag line
               (i.e. the data proper only appears after a newline) and
               continues until the beginning of either the next field
               in the same record, the next record, or the
               end-of-input tag. The overall structure looks as
               follows:

                 *RECORD*
                 *FIELD* NO
                 *FIELD* TI
                 *FIELD* TX
                 ...
                 *RECORD*
                 *FIELD* NO
                 *FIELD* TI
                 ...
                 *RECORD*
                 *FIELD* NO
                 ...
                 *FIELD* CD
                 *FIELD* ED
                 *THEEND*

               All the data relevant to the parser can be found in the
               TI field.

    # retrieving original keys in random order vs in descending
    # numerical order. On the one hand starting with high accessions
