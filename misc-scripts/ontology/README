    THE ENSEMBL ONTOLOGY DATABASE
    ====================================================================

    MOTIVATION
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    Starting with release 55 of Ensembl we provide an ontology database
    called ensembl_ontology_NN (where 'NN' is the number of the
    release).  It replaces the older ensembl_go_NN database which used
    to be loaded straight from the public table dumps provided by the
    Gene Ontology group (and hence weren't really an Ensembl database to
    start with).  The older ensembl_go_NN database also had an external
    Perl API associated with it which often made working with GO terms
    in Ensembl slightly awkward, or at least more cumbersome than what
    it needed to be.

    The new database, and its associated native Ensembl Core API, is an
    attempt to make it easy to work with ontology terms in Ensembl.

    The database also contains Sequence Ontology (SO) terms even though
    these are not yet cross-referenced or otherwise used by Ensembl.


    THE DATABASE SCHEMA
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    The ensembl_ontology_NN database consist of eight tables and a
    number of auxiliary tables.

    - ontology
      The 'ontology' table contains one entry for each "namespace",
      that is, for what the Gene Ontology group calls "ontology" and
      which is called "namespace" in OBO files.  For GO this boils
      down to entries for 'molecular_function', 'cellular_component',
      and 'biological_process', and for SO this is a single 'sequence'
      entry.

      The fields are 'name' (either "GO" or "SO" for now) and
      'namespace'.  The function of this table is to separate ontology
      terms belonging to different ontologies and/or namespaces.

    - subset
      The 'subset' table contains information about each of the subsets
      of the loaded ontologies.  GO subsets includes, for example,
      GOSlim GOA ('goslim_goa').

    - term
      The 'term' table contains the ontology term accession, name,
      and definition as well as a reference to its namespace in the
      'ontology' table and the set of subsets that it belongs to within
      that ontology (if any).

    - synonym
      This table contains all synonyms that a term has.

    - relation_type
      The 'relation_type' table simply contains the different types
      of relationships that are defined between the ontology terms.

      For GO, the relationship types are currently 'is_a', 'part_of',
      'regulates', 'positively_regulates', and 'negatively_regulates'.

      For SO, the relationship types are currently 'is_a',
      'adjacent_to', 'derives_from', 'has_part', 'member_of',
      'non_functional_homolog_of', 'part_of', 'position_of',
      'sequence_of', and 'variant_of'.

    - relation
      The 'relation' table ties together the 'relation_type' table with
      the 'term' table.  Each entry consists of reference to a child
      term, to a parent term, and to a relation type.

      There should not exist any relation between two terms belonging to
      different namespaces.

    - closure
      The 'closure' table contains the transitive closure over a
      selection of transitive relation types.  The transitive relation
      types currently covered are 'is_a', 'part_of'.

      Each entry in the 'closure' table consists of a reference to a
      child term, to one of its ancestor terms ("parent"), a reference
      to an immediate child of the ancestor, called the sub-parent,
      and the distance between the child and the ancestor through the
      sub-parent (see figure below).

                    [parent]
                       |
                       +--------------------------+
                       |                          |
                   [subparent]    [other children of parent term]
                       |                          |
                       :          +---------------+
                       :          :
              [other terms in the hierarchy]
                             :
                             :
                             |
                          [child]

      This table is computed by a Perl program (see below) from the
      'relation' table and allows for quick retrieval of all ancestors
      of a particular ontology term, or of all its descendants.

    - meta
      The 'meta' table holds meta information about the data in the
      database, such as the time-stamp from the OBO files that were
      loaded into it and when the load into the database happened.

    - aux_XX_YY_map
      The various tables named 'aux_XX_YY_map', e.g.,
      'aux_GO_goslim_goa_map' and 'aux_SO_SOFA_map', are simple mapping
      tables that maps term IDs from the 'XX' ontology ("GO" or "SO") to
      the term(s) in the 'YY' subset.

      The mapping tables are created using the information stored in the
      'closure' table, and therefore it will be based on the 'is_a' and
      'part_of' relationships.


    SCOPE OF API IMPLEMENTATION
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    The aim of the re-design of the way ontology terms are used with
    Ensembl is not to provide a generic API for ontology terms but
    instead to provide the ability to use ontology terms in straight
    forward querying for standard Ensembl objects such as genes,
    transcripts, and translations.  Hence, the API will treat the
    ontology database as read-only.

    The operations available on the ontology terms themselves are
    restricted to querying them for their basic attributes such as
    the term accession, name, and definition, as well as relational
    information such as their immediate parent and/or child terms.
    For a selection of transitive relationship types (currently the
    relation types 'is_a' and 'part_of') we also provide fast access
    to the set of all parent and/or child terms of any given term.

    The connection between the ontology terms and the genes,
    transcripts, and translations of Ensembl is currently based on GO
    term cross-references (Xrefs).  We do not yet cross-reference SO
    terms to any of these object types.


    SUPPORTED OPERATIONS
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    The ontology term adaptor, Bio::EnsEMBL::DBSQL::OntologyTermAdaptor,
    supports the following operations:

    1.  Fetching one ontology term from the database

      1.a   by accession
            $adaptor->fetch_by_accession($accession)

      1.b   by internal ID
            $adaptor->fetch_by_dbID($dbID)

      1.c   by name or synonym
            $adaptor->fetch_all_by_name($synonym, $ontology)

    2.  Fetching a set of terms from the database

      2.a   by name or synonym pattern (e.g. "%splice_site%")
            $adaptor->fetch_all_by_name($pattern)

      2.b   by a collection of internal IDs
            $adaptor->fetch_all_by_dbID_list(\@dbIDs)

      2.c   by their (immediate) parent term
            $adaptor->fetch_all_by_parent_term($term)

      2.d   by their (immediate) child term
            $adaptor->fetch_all_by_child_term($term)

      2.e   by an ancestor term
            $adaptor->fetch_all_by_ancestor_term($term)

      2.f   by a descendant term
            $adaptor->fetch_all_by_descendant_term($term)

    3.  Fetching a structure that encodes the ancestor relationships of
        a term.
        $adaptor->_fetch_ancestor_chart($term)

    Given an ontology term, which is a Bio::EnsEMBL::OntologyTerm
    object, some operations from the second set of operations above are
    also available on the object itself (2.b--2.e):

    4.  Fetching a set of terms from the database

      4.a   by their (immediate) parent term
            $term->children()

      4.b   by their (immediate) child term
            $term->parents()

      4.c   by an ancestor term
            $term->descendants()

      4.d   by a descendant term
            $term->ancestors()


    ADDITIONS TO THE EXISTING ENSEMBL CORE API
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    To enable to use ontology terms in querying for Ensembl objects,
    two methods were added to GeneAdaptor, TranscriptAdaptor, and to
    TranslationAdaptor:

      - fetch_all_by_GOTerm()

      - fetch_all_by_GOTerm_accession()

    Given a GO term object, the fetch_all_by_GOTerm() method uses
    the DBEntryAdaptor to fetch objects that are cross-referenced
    with the GO term or with any of its descendants.  The
    fetch_all_by_GOTerm_accession() method works similarly, but
    instead of a GO term object it takes a GO term accession.


    COMPLETE EXAMPLE PROGRAMS
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    See the Perl programs 'scripts/demo1.pl' and 'scripts/demo2.pl'.


    CREATING THE ONTOLOGY DATABASE
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    To create the ensembl_ontology_NN database for a release, the
    following steps needs to be followed:

    1.  Create the empty database by doing "CREATE DATABASE
        ensembl_ontology_NN" (where 'NN' is the current release) on ens-staging1.

    2.  Load the schema from 'tables.sql' located in
        ensembl/misc-scripts/ontology/sql/

    3.  Update the url for SO.obo file in script 'get_OBO_files.ksh' to the latest
        released version, if the version is not already up to date.
        Check directory: http://sourceforge.net/projects/song/files/Sequence%20Ontology/
	for available releases of the SO.obo file.

    3.  Run script 'get_OBO_files.ksh' to download all the currently
	handled ontologies.
	perl get_OBO_files.ksh 

    4.  As a prerequisite to the next step, you'll need to install
	ONTO-PERL modules from: 
        http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/E/EA/EASR/ONTO-PERL/ONTO-PERL-1.31.tar.gz  
	or use the version installed in: /software/perl-5.8.8/lib/site_perl/5.8.8
	and add the path where the module is installed to your perl path

    5.  Load the data from each downloaded ontology (curently we download GO, SO and EFO)
    	file into the database using the script 'load_OBO_file.pl' (run the script without arguments
        for help on usage, it is simple).  The script lives in
        ensembl/misc-scripts/ontology/scripts/

	e.g.: perl load_OBO_file.pl -h ens-staging1 -u ensadmin -p xxx -d ensembl_ontology_67 -f GO.obo -o GO 


    6.  Delete the 'UNKNOWN' ontology row from the ontology table. 
        Once you're finished loading all the ontology files run the load_OBO_file.pl script 
	with option -delete_unknown:
	e.g.: perl load_OBO_file.pl -h ens-staging1 -u ensadmin -p xxx -d ensembl_ontology_67 -delete_unknown

	The script will delete the dummy ontology if none of the loaded terms are still linked to it.
	It will report a problem in case it finds any terms linked to the UNKNOWN ontology.
	This may indicate that you haven't loaded all the files as definitions for some terms are missing.

    7.  Compute the transitive closure (the 'closure' table in the
        database) by running the 'compute_closure.pl' in almost the same
        way as in step 4.  This step may take some time.

	e.g.: perl compute_closure.pl -h ens-staging1 -u ensadmin -p xxx -d ensembl_ontology_67	

    8.  Add the auxiliary map tables by running 'add_subset_maps.pl'
        with the same arguments that you used for the script in the
        previous step.
	
	e.g.: perl add_subset_maps.pl  -h ens-staging1 -u ensadmin -p xxx -d ensembl_ontology_67

    9.  Copy the newly created database to ens-staging2 using ensembl/misc-srcipts/CopyDBOverServer.pl script.
