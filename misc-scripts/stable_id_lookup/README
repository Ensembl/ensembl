The stable_id database is used by the Registry method get_species_and_object_type().
EnsEMBL REST API heavily relies on this method.

The database can be created on one of the staging servers once all the release databases, which contain
stable_ids to be copied into the stable_id database, are ready.

Currently the following stable ids are copied:

core	  Exon
	  Gene
	  Transcript
	  Translation
	  Operon
	  OperonTranscript


For Gene, Transcript and Translation, an archive_id_lookup is also created, containing all previously used ids



Command to create the stable_id database on ens-staging1 and copy stable ids from databases on ens-staging1 and 2:

RELEASE=70
DIR=ensembl/misc-scripts/stable_id_lookup
USR=''
PASS=''

cd $DIR
bsub -q normal -M 700000 -R'select[mem>700] rusage[mem=700]' -o ./stable_ids_${RELEASE}.out -e ./stable_ids_${RELEASE}.err perl populate_stable_id_lookup.pl \
-lhost ens-staging1 -luser $USR -lpass $PASS -create -host ens-staging1 -host ens-staging2 -user ensro


For release 74, the job consumed 584Mb of memory and took 1hr 53 minutes to run
