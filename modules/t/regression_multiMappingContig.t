# TEST CASE TO RECREATE HUMAN CONTIG MAPPING ISSUE
# 
# GRCh38 used the same contig in full in multiple locations on the same chromosome. The
# original mapper code would only give the 1st mapping & then ignores anything else.
# Here we have 3 fake contigs each composed of 4 bases; A, C & T. These map to chr1
# and only contigs A & C are repeated.
