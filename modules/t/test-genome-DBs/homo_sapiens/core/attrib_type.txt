417	gencode_basic	GENCODE basic annotation	GENCODE Basic is a view provided by UCSC for users. It includes a subset of the GENCODE transcripts. In general, for protein coding genes it will show only the full length models (unless a protein coding gene has no full-length models, in which case other rules apply). For noncoding genes, it will also only show the full-length (mRNA start and end found) models (unless there are no full-length models, in which case other rules apply).
428	TSL	Transcript Support Level	\N
535	MANE_Select	MANE Select v0.92	MANE Select (v0.92) is the preliminary release (phase 7) of the MANE Select data set. The Matched Annotation from NCBI and EMBL-EBI project (MANE) is a collaboration between Ensembl-GENCODE and RefSeq to select a default transcript per human protein coding locus that is representative of biology, well-supported, expressed and conserved. This transcript set matches GRCh38 and is 100% identical between RefSeq and Ensembl-GENCODE for 5' UTR, CDS, splicing and 3' UTR.
554	is_canonical	Is Canonical	Flag to state that a feature is a canonical one.
576	gencode_primary	GENCODE primary annotation	Gencode Primary replaces Gencode Basic for protein coding genes as the set of the most biologically relevant transcripts. Protein coding transcripts are compared to MANE Select or to Ensembl Canonical where MANE Select is not yet defined. The features (exons and introns) that are novel to the reference transcript are filtered and assessed for biological relevance using conservation and expression data. The transcripts having the filtered features are retained for the set. For noncoding genes, the Gencode Primary set is identical to the Gencode Basic set.
