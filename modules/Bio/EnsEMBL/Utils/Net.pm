=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Utils::Net

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::EnsEMBL::Utils::Net qw/do_GET do_FTP/;

  #Doing a HTTP get
  my $google_contents = do_GET('http://www.google.co.uk/');
  
  #Doing a FTP request; delegates onto LWP
  my $ftp_contents = do_GET('ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current_README');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A collection of subroutines aimed to helping network based operations. The code
will use HTTP::Tiny for all HTTP operations if available. Otherwise it
will delegate to LWP. LWP is currently the only supported target for FTP.

=head1 METHODS

See subroutines.

=head2 do_GET

  Arg [1]     : string $url The URL to fetch including all parameters
  Arg [2]     : int; $total_attempts The number of times to try the URL 
                before throwing an exception
  Arg [3]     : number; $sleep Amount of time to sleep between attempts. 
                Delegates onto Time::HiRes so floating point numbers are 
                supported
  Description : Performs a HTTP GET method call to return the specified remote
                resource.
  Returntype  : Scalar of the contents of the remote URL. Do not use to
                retrieve very large amounts of data.
  Example     : my $contents = do_GET('http://www.google.co.uk/');
  Exceptions  : If we could not retrieve the resource after the specified 
                number of attempts.
  Status      : Stable
