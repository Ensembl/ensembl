=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Feature - Ensembl specific sequence feature.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $feat = new Bio::EnsEMBL::Feature(
      -start  => 100,
      -end    => 220,
      -strand => -1,
      -slice  => $slice,
      -analysis => $analysis
    );

    my $start  = $feat->start();
    my $end    = $feat->end();
    my $strand = $feat->strand();

    # Move the feature to the chromosomal coordinate system
    $feature = $feature->transform('chromosome');

    # Move the feature to a different slice (possibly on another coord
    # system)
    $feature = $feature->transfer($new_slice);

    # Project the feature onto another coordinate system possibly across
    # boundaries:
    @projection = @{ $feature->project('contig') };

    # Change the start, end, and strand of the feature in place
    $feature->move( $new_start, $new_end, $new_strand );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the Base feature class from which all Ensembl features inherit.
It provides a bare minimum functionality that all features require.  It
basically describes a location on a sequence in an arbitrary coordinate
system.

  Arg [-SLICE]: Bio::EnsEMBL::SLice - Represents the sequence that this
                feature is on. The coordinates of the created feature are
                relative to the start of the slice.
  Arg [-START]: The start coordinate of this feature relative to the start
                of the slice it is sitting on.  Coordinates start at 1 and
                are inclusive.
  Arg [-END]  : The end coordinate of this feature relative to the start of
                the slice it is sitting on.  Coordinates start at 1 and are
                inclusive.
  Arg [-STRAND]: The orientation of this feature.  Valid values are 1,-1,0.
  Arg [-SEQNAME] : A seqname to be used instead of the default name of the 
                of the slice.  Useful for features that do not have an 
                attached slice such as protein features.
  Arg [-dbID]   : (optional) internal database id
  Arg [-ADAPTOR]: (optional) Bio::EnsEMBL::DBSQL::BaseAdaptor
  Example    : $feature = Bio::EnsEMBL::Feature->new(-start    => 1,

                  3. If they both have dbIDs: if these are the same,
                     then they are equal, otherwise not.

               Specified when a projection may land on many overlapping slices
               and disambiguation is required.
  Example    : $feature = $feature->transform('contig');
               next if(!defined($feature));
  Description: Returns a copy of this feature, but converted to a different
               coordinate system. The converted feature will be placed on a
               slice which spans an entire sequence region of the new
               coordinate system. If the requested coordinate system is the
               same coordinate system it is simply placed on a slice which
               spans the entire seq_region (as opposed to the original slice
               which may have only partially covered the seq_region).

               If a feature spans a boundary in the new coordinate system,
               undef is returned instead.

               For example, transforming an exon in contig coordinates to one 
               in chromosomal coodinates will place the exon on a slice of an 
               entire chromosome.

  Description: Returns the results of 'projecting' this feature onto another

               would lie in a coordinate system in which it

               triplets [from_start,from_end,to_Slice]. The from_start and
               from_end are the coordinates relative to the feature start.
               For example, if a feature is current 100-200bp on a slice
               then the triplets returned might be:
               [1,50,$slice1],
               [51,101,$slice2]

               The to_Slice is a slice spanning the region on the requested

               If the feature projects entirely into a gap then a reference to

  Arg [1]    : Bio::EnsEMBL::Feature $f
               The other feature you want to check overlap with this feature

  Description: This method does a range comparison of this feature's C<seq_region_start> and
               C<seq_region_end> and compares it with another feature's C<seq_region_start>
               and C<seq_region_end>. It will return true if these ranges overlap 
               and the features are on the same seq_region.

               For local coordinate overlaps tests (those values returned from
               start and end) use C<overlaps_local()>.
